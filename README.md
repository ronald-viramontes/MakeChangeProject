# Make Change

### Overview

The primary purpose of the MakeChange Java application is to function as a cash register.
This enables the user [cashier] to input the cost of a single item, amount tendered,
and then display the item cost, amount tendered, and change due to the customer.

### How to use
The user can execute the code in a JavaSE-1.8 compatible console of their choosing.
The output will display a store front message along with the prompts to enter the cost of 
the item and amount tendered.

A separate message is displayed if amount tendered equals item cost.
Additionally, an error message is displayed if the amount tendered is
less than the cost of the item.

The program will display the cost of the item, amount tendered, change due to the customer,
along with a breakdown of the number of individual bills/coins that are due back to the 
customer. 

### Technologies
  * Eclipse IDE with JavaSE-1.8
  * if/else if/else 
  * Modulus Operator
  * System Output

### Lessons Learned

The key takeaway for me while developing this program includes:
	- Taking a step back and try writing out on paper what you want the program to do.  
	  I struggled with identifying syntax that would appropriately/accurately display 
	  the breakdown of bills and change due back to the customer.
	- The modulus operator is a powerful tool that enabled me to complete this program.
	  Modulus was pivotal is providing the means to breakdown the individual number of 
	  bills/coins that were due back to the customer.
    - Don't be afraid to ask for help from your peers or other subject matter
    	  experts.
	- Finally, have fun!
